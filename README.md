# Chicago After School Evaluation

This project evaluated the effects of after school programming from a national provider on student outcomes in Chicago Public Schools (CPS). The outcomes in question included gains in ISAT reading and math scores, reading and math grades, school day attendance, and whether or not a student was suspended. The evaluation focused on effects of dosage within a given school year, where dosage was defined as the number of weeks students spent in the program. Three years were examined: the school years ending in 2014, 2013, and 2012. This repository includes code for the analysis of gains in ISAT reading scores in school year 2014.

## Methodology

This evaluation used multilevel regression to determine the effect of after school dosage on student outcomes. These models have the advantage of accounting for random variation in student outcomes due to the particular school attended, while also accounting for potential selection biases due to demographic variables such as gender, ethnicity, proxies for socioeconomic status, and others.
